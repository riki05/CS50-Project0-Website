        <h1>2.Uses of Saffron</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Saffron has been used since ages for imparting color and flavor in culinary as well as traditional medicine. <br>
                <br>
                Cuisines from many different countries such as Iran and India use saffron as an important condiment. <br>
                <br>
                It is also used in traditional medicine for healthcare benefits including but not limiting to skin, eyes and heart.
                For this purpose, it is often consumed with warm milk or soaked in water and applied topically (Mousavi and Bathaie, 2011). <br>
                <br>
                It has been shown to effectively treat depression and is a potential medicine for sexual dysfunction, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, 
                pre-menstrual syndrome, retinal disease and weight loss (Wright, 2014). <br>
                <br>
                It has also been demonstrated to have antitumor and cancer preventive activities in animal models as well as cultured human
                cell lines (Samarghandian and Borji, 2014). <br>
                <br>
                These properties of saffron can be attributed to its major chemical components crocin,
                crocetin, safranal and picrocrocin which impart color, taste and odor. 
                The quantity of these pigments in dried saffron defines the quality of the product (Lage and Cantrell, 2009).
