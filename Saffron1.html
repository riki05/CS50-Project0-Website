        <h1>1.What is Crocus sativus?</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
            Crocus sativus is a member of the Iridaceae family that includes herbs with rhizomes, corms or bulbs. 
            It is a perennial autumn flowering herb. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The species in genus Crocus have underground fleshy starch storing organs called corms.
            A corm is an underground stem that forms base for the flower stem. 
            Leaves are basal, grass-like, dark green with whitish median strip.
            A plant may have one or several flowers which typically contain 3 stigmas each.
            The dry form of stigma is available commercially as saffron. 
             
            </p>
            <p>
            It is a sterile triploid (n=8) which undergoes aberrant meiosis and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction. 
            All propagation is therefore, by vegetative multiplication of corm and depends on human assistance. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Sprouting, flowering, leaf development, development of daughter corms and dormancy are the 5 major stages of its annual life cycle (Lopez-Corcoles et al., 2015). 
            Corms are planted around mid August to mid September which is followed by flowering in mid October up to November. 
            Leaves may appear with or after flowers and remain green for 6-8 months, until April/May, during which daughter corms develop from the mother corm. 
            Mother corm produces up to 10 cormlets that grow on top of it (Nehvi et al., 2006). 
            This stage is also known as the vegetative phase. 
            After the daughter corms are completely developed, leaves turn brown and dry out as the corms enter dormant stage. 
            Clusters of dormant corms can be then dug up, divided and stored or sold for sowing in the next season.
