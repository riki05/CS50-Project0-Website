## This website is a brief introduction of Saffron spice, its uses, production and corm rot diseases of saffron. This work is part of my PhD thesis.

Second page throws light on the plant (Crocus sativus) from which saffron is derived.

Third page contains uses of saffron for traditional and medicinal purposes.

Fourth page gives a brief information on production of saffron around the world.

The last page provides information on corm rot diseases of saffron, pathogens reported to cause disease in saffron plant and tabulated results of pot trials to test the efficacy of a native biological control agent to reduce corm rot incidence and severity.
